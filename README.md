## Practice Summary

In this practice, a dynamic system modeling the interaction between three biological populations was performed. Using experimental data obtained in vitro, a smoothing process and temporal analysis of the information were carried out. Next, a model based on nonlinear differential equations was developed and fitted using regression techniques to optimize its accuracy. The system’s equilibrium points, stability, and convergence towards steady states were studied. Finally, graphs of the variables’ trajectories were generated along with a visual representation of the biological interaction. This method facilitated understanding the system dynamics and the influence of different parameters on its behavior.

## Specific Objectives

1. Preprocess the experimental data using smoothing techniques to reduce noise in the original signal.

2. Formulate a mathematical model describing the dynamic interaction between the three biological populations.

3. Fit the model parameters via nonlinear regression so that simulations align with the smoothed experimental data.

4. Analyze system stability by evaluating equilibrium points and eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix associated with the model.

5. Graphically represent the interaction among biological populations using BioRender.
